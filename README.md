# AirBnB Clone Project

## Description
This project is the first step in building a simple clone of the AirBnB website.  
It will be developed in multiple stages throughout the year, starting with a command-line interpreter to manage AirBnB objects.

The main goal of this project is to learn and practice:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python
- File storage using JSON
- Unit testing
- Building a console (command interpreter)
- Preparing for web development (HTML, CSS, MySQL, REST API)

---

## The Command Interpreter
This command interpreter will allow us to:
- Create new objects (User, Place, City, etc.)
- Retrieve objects from storage
- Update object attributes
- Destroy objects
- Persist data between runs

---

## How to Start It
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/alu-AirBnB_clone.git
